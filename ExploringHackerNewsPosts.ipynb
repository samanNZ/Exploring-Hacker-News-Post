    "# Exploring Hacker News Post\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study we will explore (a sample of) posts that were posted on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",

    "*Post title*: when creating posts, users can - optionally - add `Ask HN` or `Show HN` to the title of the post. They do so to explicitly 'ask' or 'show' something to the Hacker News community. We'll analyze whether posts with these tags receive more comments on average.\n",
